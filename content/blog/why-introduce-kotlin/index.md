### The story of Kotlin
Kotlin has been created by JetBrains, the company behind Intellij IDEA and was originally designed
as a fully interoperable with existing codebase alternative to Java programming language.
In 2012, it became open source on Apache 2 license. 

The first stable version 1.0 has been released in February 2016 and since then its popularity
started growing very fast. At the beginning Kotlin has become very popular in Android development,
because of the possibility to compile to Java 6 bytecode. As a result in 2017 it has been announced
by Google as the official and recommended language for the Android platform. 
Kotlin is also getting more and more popular in the backend development - starting from
the version 5 of Spring Framework it is one of the officially supported languages.

### Benefits
So, why Kotlin is gaining more and more popularity?

There are many reasons, but the most important include:
 - Kotlin is full interoperable with Java codebase
 - Kotlin is quite simple to learn, especially for Java developers
 - Kotlin is safe and can catch NullPointerExceptions on compiler level
 - Kotlin has modern and concise syntax
 - Kotlin has very good tooling and compiler is fast
 - It's easier to introduce Kotlin in projects written in Java 8, 7, 6 than migrate to newer Java versions
 - Kotlin is much more functional language than Java 

### Tools

One of the Kotlin's strengths is tooling. This is not a surprise, as it has been developed
by a company behind the best IDE in the world. 

Starting from IDEs - Intellij IDEA and Android Studio has great support for Kotlin, comparable
with Java (which has been developed for about 20 years!) or even better. 
One of the killer features is bytecode viewer, which really helps to understand what is going on under the hood of the fancy syntax. 
There is also Java to Kotlin converter available, which can help you a lot in transforming your existing Java code into Kotlin.
For Eclipse and NetBeans there are plugins, which also offer quite good support for Kotlin. 

To start the journey with Kotlin, the online
playground is available. It is really awesome and contains many example code snippets useful for learning.
The playground is available [here](https://try.kotlinlang.org/).

Kotlin also have interactive shell available after installation, which may be useful for 
experimenting with the syntax. 

### Learning

The good staring point is the Kotlin playground mentioned in the tooling section. 

There are also many books available in the market. I can recommend the [Kotlin in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action)
by Dmitry Jemerov and Svetlana Isakova. 

If you prefer video courses, I recommend [Kotlin for Java Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers?) 
by the same authors.

Of course, there is also the Kotlin reference documentation, which is a very good learning resource. It can be found [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/).
