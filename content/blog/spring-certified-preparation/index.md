### Spring Certification

Spring Certified Professional is a certification program from Pivotal. The program was designed to validate 
knowledge of Spring Framework ecosystem. The details about the exam

 - Container (20%)
 - AOP (8%)

 - JPA Spring Data (4%)
 - Testing (4%)
 - Boot Intro (8%)
 - Boot Autoconfig (8%)
 - Boot Actuator (8%)
 - Boot Testing (8%) 


### Learning
I've passed the exam in February 2020. Preparations took about 2 months, but previously I've been using various Spring modules in my daily work for about 3 years. 

I started with Spring using the official tutorial from Pivotal. There is a lot of 15 minutes
guides to familiarize yourself with some framework functionality. In my opinion this is the best way to start.

The next step is to create a few small projects with Spring, using different available modules.
During making these projects you will probably use Spring Reference documentation a lot - really recommended, it is very good.

After making some projects it is good to read some books (I can recommend "Spring in Action") to structure the knowledge and read the 
official documentation from cover to cover.

The last step, but in my opinion the most important one is to read the source code of the framework and
try to understand it. There is no better way to learn some framework mechanisms than reading 
their implementation. Simple as that ! :)

### Useful materials for the exam

Ok, so you know Spring now? Let's pass the exam then. It is definitely possible to pass 
the exam without preparation if you already know Spring framework quite good, but 
it costs about $200, so it's better to make sure you're ready.

The first source is the exam guide published on certification site. 

Here is the link: [Guide](https://pivotalcontent.s3.amazonaws.com/academy/Spring-Professional-Certification-Study-Guide.pdf)

The guide with the official Spring reference documentation are the two main sources in exam preparations.

If you prefer a book, I really recommend [Core Spring 5 Certification in Detail](https://leanpub.com/corespring5certificationindetail) by Ivan Krizsan.
It's really awesome!

It's also good to verify the knowledge before taking the exam using some mock exams.
[Spring Mock Exams](https://www.springmockexams.com/) is one of the websites which may be useful here.

### Benefits

So, what are the benefits of this certification?

In my opinion the most important ones are:
 - motivation for learning 
 - better understanding of the most popular Java framework
 - knowledge of the available tools, helps to make better architecture decisions
 - a shareable document from one of the most recognized companies in Java world
