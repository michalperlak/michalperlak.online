### Intro
"From NAND to Tetris" is a two part course series designed to teach computer science studens low-level concepts which are the foundations for the modern computer hardware architecture, programming languages and platforms. It is very useful for high level
programming language developers to refresh the knowledge about the basics and have a lot of fun building a computer from scratch.

The first part focuses on hardware, starting from basic logical gates and going through CPU and memory design, IO handling and finishing on assemby language for the designed platform.

The second part is about designing virtual machines, operating systems, high level languages and compilers. 

### From NAND to Tetris part 1

The first course is divided into 6 weeks. The idea is very simple - every week build some higher level component and
use it in the next week project. 

Week 1 starts with basic logic gates and how to design higher level chips from them.
During week 2 the elements designed during the first week are used to build some more complex elements and finally the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) which will be the heart of the CPU.

The week 3 is focused on memory design and how to use gate logic to store values persistently. The outcome of this week is RAM(Random Access Memory) chip and PC(Program Counter) register.

During week 4 the machine language for the future hardware platform is designed. The week 5 is focused on designing the final hardware platform - the Hack computer, using components created in previous weeks.

The last week is about designing the higher level interface for our platform - assembly language.
